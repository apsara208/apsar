#Hashing is a technique used in data structures that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that allows for quick access.
#The great thing about hashing is, we can achieve all three operations (search, insert and delete) in O(1) time on average.

#key must be an immutable data type
#hashmaps: dictionaries
